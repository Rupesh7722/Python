GS Quant allows for access to more complex market models and associated measures. These are functions which allow more
intuitive slicing of various market-model based datasets. Examples of this would include:

| Measure            | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Implied Volatility | Historical implied volatility curve for different strikes and tenors                          |
| Normalized Skew    | Difference in volatility between out-of-the-money and in-the-money option (Put - call ) / ATM |
| Term Structure     | Forward looking term structures of volatility or forward levels at a given point in time      |

## Skew

<note>Examples require an initialized GsSession and data subscription, please refer to
<a href="/docs/gsquant/guides/Authentication/2-gs-session">Sessions</a> for details</note>

The following example shows how to char historical skew level for SPX:

```python
from datetime import date
from gs_quant.data import DataContext
from gs_quant.markets.securities import SecurityMaster, AssetIdentifier
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import gs_quant.timeseries as ts

data_ctx = DataContext(start=date(2018, 1, 1), end=date(2018, 12, 31))  # Create a data context covering 2018
spx = SecurityMaster.get_asset('SPX', AssetIdentifier.TICKER)           # Lookup S&P 500 Index via the Security Master

with data_ctx:                                                          # Use the data context we setup
    skew = ts.skew(spx, '1m', ts.SkewReference.DELTA, 25)               # Get 25 delta skew
    skew.plot(title='SPX 25 Delta Skew')

plt.show()                                                              # Plot output
```

Should produce something like this:
